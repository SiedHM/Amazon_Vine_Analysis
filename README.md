# Overview of the project 
The purpose of this project is to analyses the reviews rewritten by Amazon paid Vine program and non-vine(unpaid) shoes buyers. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.
In this project, I used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. I also used PySpark, to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.
